# Swingin--Good-Time
 
This is a game about getting to the end of level in the shortest amount of time without touching the lava.

## Installation
 
When you download the files from github, unzip it. Use Unity Hub to open the files in Unity. When it asks you if you want to fix anything say "Ignore". Continue this until you get to the regular Unity screen. Go to Build Settings and click "Build and Run". This should start to build the project into a playable executable that can be started.
