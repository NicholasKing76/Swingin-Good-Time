# Swingin--Good-Time
 
This is a game about getting to the end of level in the shortest amount of time without touching the lava.

## Installation
 
When you download the files from github, unzip it. Use Unity Hub to open the files in Unity. When it asks you if you want to fix anything say "Ignore". Continue this until you get to the regular Unity screen. Go to Build Settings and click "Build and Run". This should start to build the project into a playable executable that can be started.

Clicking quit game will close the application, clicking how to play will take you to a screen that shows the basic controls and tells you what the objective is, and play game will take you to the level select screen. On the level select screen the player can pick from any of three levels. They also have an option to reset the times on the levels if they wish to and they can return to the main menu.
